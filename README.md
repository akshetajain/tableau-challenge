ANALYSIS

AGE DEMOGRAPHICS ANALYSIS
These two visualizations are measuring the Number of Bike Trips by Birth Year. According to the data, people born in 1969 distinctly primarily utilize the Citi Bike program. This phenomenon may be occuring because the stations are near neighborhoods catering to people born in 1969. After this category, usage is primarily by Mllennials and Generation Z. This is probably due to an emphasis on reducing carbon emmissions by youer generations, as well as an emphasis on health and wellness. 

GENDER DEMOGRAPHICS ANALYSIS
These visualizations are exploring usage of the Citi Bike program by gender. According to the data, men distinctly use the city bike program more than women. In an attempt to explore why this may be occuring, I explore the average duration of bike usage by each gender. The average duration seemed relatively similar. It is possible this phenomenon is occuring because the stations for  Citi Bike are near offices for male-dominated industries. Thus, Citi Bike commuters may be distinctly male. 

STATION POPULARITY ANALYSIS
As demonstrated by the below map, areas with the cluster of blue dots are the most popular Citi Bike stations. Possible reasons for this may be a high volume of commuters who live here or less subway access.
